Title: 'RStudio' Add-in to Insert Markdown Citations (simple version)
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Amy Chan
Maintainer: Amy Chan <mathematical.coffee@gmail.com>
Description: Autocomplete for citekeys of a bibfile, implemented as an RStudio
    add-in. Search is quite rudimentary. Meant to supplement `citr` by offering
    an autocomplete with very few keystrokes if you already know the start of the
    citekey.
